## Debian-Based Systems

Getting started on Debian-based systems is straightforward with the interactive install script. Run the following command to begin the installation process:

```bash
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshm998/dugong/main/install.sh)"
```
Please read the script here before running it locally. For other platforms see the release page for binaries that can be installed and configured.

## Other Linux Distros
Dugong is a single binary which means installation on other linux distros can be done through manual binary installation or systemd service setup.

##### 1. Download the Latest Release
First, download the latest release from the releases page or use the command below to automatically fetch it:
```bash
VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/joshm998/dugong/releases/latest | grep -o '"tag_name": ".*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
wget https://github.com/joshm998/dugong/releases/download/${VERSION}/dugong_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64
```

##### 2. Make the Binary Executable
Once downloaded, make the binary executable and move it to your desired location:
```bash
chmod +x dugong_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64
sudo mv dugong_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/dugong
```

##### 3. Create the Configuration Directory
Next, create the configuration directory that will store configuration files and data:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p ~/config/dugong/data
```

##### 4. Create Environment Configuration
Create an environment file to store configuration settings:
```bash
sudo nano ~/config/dugong/config.env
```

Example `~/.config/dugong/config.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=~/.config/dugong/data/app.db
CERT_DIR=~/.config/dugong/data
GENERATE_CERTIFICATES=false
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_secret
SERVER_ADDR=8080
CERT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

##### 5. Create a Systemd Service
Create the systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dugong.service
```

Systemd service configuration:
```
[Unit]
Description=Dugong Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
EnvironmentFile=/etc/dugong/config.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dugong
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

##### 6. Manage the Service
Reload systemd to apply changes, enable the service to start on boot, and manage its status:
```bash
# Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable dugong.service

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start dugong.service

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status dugong.service
```

sudo mv dugong_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/dugong
```

##### 3. Create the Configuration Directory
Next, create the configuration directory that will store configuration files and data:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p ~/config/dugong/data
```

##### 4. Create a Shell Script to Manage the Environment
Create a script named start-dugong.sh to manage the environment variables and start Dugong:
```bash
# Create a shell script to manage environment
nano start-dugong.sh
```

Add the following contents to `start-dugong.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export DATABASE_URL=./app.db
export CERT_DIR=./data
export GENERATE_CERTIFICATES=false
export JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_secret
export SERVER_ADDR=8080
export CERT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com

./dugong
```

##### 5. Make the Script Executable
Set the script as executable and run it:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x start-dugong.sh

# Run the script
./start-dugong.sh
```
